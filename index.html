		Ok, so here is the gist of the game.  The total score that you want to achieve is under the Random Total Generated on the top right under these instructions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of the four crystals has been assigned a random number between one and twelve.  If the random numbers generated are all ever and you happen to have an odd total number....well sorry but you cannot win.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you win it will keep track of total wins, same with the losses.
	</p>
	<p>
		I will work on improving the graphics but it took a lot longer than anticipated just to get the gameplay working correctly....and ulitmately it is free to play.
